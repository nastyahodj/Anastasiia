## Conclusion
A preliminary tariff analysis was done on a small sample of customers. Two hypotheses were tested. The first hypothesis, that the average revenue from users of "Ultra" and "Smart" tariffs differs, was confirmed.  The second hypothesis, that users from Moscow bring more revenue than users from other cities, was not confirmed.
