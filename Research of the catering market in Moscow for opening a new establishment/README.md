## Conclusion
Recommendations for opening a new establishment:
It is recommended to open a new coffee shop in South-West Administrative District or South-East Administrative District. 
- It is worth focusing on the cost of a cup of cappuccino in the range of 124-225r (or up to 175r - this is the average price).
- Pay attention to 458 streets with one institution. It is worth considering that there are also such streets in the centre, this may be due to the fact that the streets are short. 
- The average cheque in non-network coffee shops is 381r. 
- Only 59 out of 1413 coffee shops are round-the-clock. It may be an advantage to open such a coffee shop if there are few such establishments from other categories nearby.
