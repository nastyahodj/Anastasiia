# Conclusion
This project explored the principles of event analytics. I studied the user journey from visiting the homepage to purchase through the sales funnel. Analysed the results of an A/B test of the introduction of new fonts. Gave recommendations to the marketing team.

The sales funnel is as follows: 
1) the user sees the main screen of the site
2) the user goes to the product he likes
3) the user adds the product to the basket and goes to it
4) the user pays for the order
